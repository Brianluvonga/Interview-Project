# Interview-Project

Interview project to gauge my skills with flutter.
1. Create a navigationbar preferrably bottom navigation with animation from which navigation items would be added for easy transition
2. The application mainly includes passing textfield data to another screen. This was to be achieved automatically where after submitting the entry form,
one is automatically navigated to another screen displaying the data enterred.
3. The application also makes an api call to a json reference and returns the data in a listview.
4. Use of animation when navigating to another page
